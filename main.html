	<h1>Time,Space complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity can be understand as the time taken by the program to run and complete the program </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program.For example if a program takes an array of size n as input the time complexity of program is 0(n)</p>
